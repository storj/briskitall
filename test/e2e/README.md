# End-to-End Testing

This directory contains helper scripts used to test brisk-it-all against a
"real" test network. Geth developer mode is fine for unit-testing but
unfortunately does not support using an external signer (via --signer). This
means we cannot use Geth developer mode to teste against clef-managed accounts.

## Prerequisites

- Go
- docker
- jq

## Bootstrapping

To bootstrap the test, run:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh

This script prepares a `./runtime` directory with all of the necessary
configuration, including:

1. Geth data directory initialized with:
    - Proof of stake consensus (with signer accounts seeded with 10000 ETH each).
    - [Test accounts](../testdata) seeded with 10 ETH each.
1. Beacon chain data directory.
1. Clef masterseed and keystore with all [test accounts](../testdata) imported.
    - password for masterseed and all accounts is placed in `./runtime/clef/pwd.txt`

# Starting

1. Start clef. This is run outside of docker-compose because its easier to interact with it for approving transactions, etc. You will be prompted to enter the master password, which will have been printed just above the prompt for convenience. It is also stored in the ./runtime/clef/pwd.txt file.

    $ ./clef.sh

2. Bring up geth and the prysm beacon chain and validtor.

    $ docker compose up -d

# Playing Around

The `./briskitall.sh` script is a small helper script that wraps execution of `briskitall` with a few helpful environment variables (e.g. the chain ID, the geth node URL, the clef endpoint).

## Deploy the MultiSig contract

First things first, you probably want to deploy the MultiSig contract. The following command will deploy the contract using the root account with account-0 and account-1 as the initial set of owners:

    $ ./briskitall.sh test deploy multisig $(cat ../testdata/account-0.addr) $(cat ../testdata/account-1.addr) --sender $(cat ../testdata/root.addr)
    ETH[0x4354d30f214b930e153ddaa6bac05ed210b8fd19e7c5e0abc351be559780bb10]: Sent ðŸ“„ 
    ETH[0x4354d30f214b930e153ddaa6bac05ed210b8fd19e7c5e0abc351be559780bb10]: Confirmed âœ… 
    MultiSig contract address: 0x7A35a1584FDD8c88B0Fe60f21199CF6eEeCAA0fe

For convenience, you can export the `BRISKATALL_MULTISIG_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable with the contract address output by the deploy command. Alternatively you can pass it via the `--multisig-contract-address` flag to all commands that need it:

    $ export BRISKITALL_MULTISIG_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x7A35a1584FDD8c88B0Fe60f21199CF6eEeCAA0fe

Then to check that everything is working, you can list the owners:

    $ ./briskitall.sh query multisig owner list
    0x46f40B6B0dFDa35A8b6247489669a83c69804F3a
    0xBA4e70c2dc335aa86c6BF55F80d631Cf846435F0

## Deploy the Token contract

Now the token contract can be deployed with the MultiSig contract as the owner:

    $ ./briskitall.sh test deploy token "${BRISKITALL_MULTISIG_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}" --sender $(cat ../testdata/root.addr)
    ETH[0x2fec25f4d138267e00b1b95fe9bd6c2691ae4d6ce334dbc2f1be9106cba3bcdf]: Sent ðŸ“„ 
    ETH[0x2fec25f4d138267e00b1b95fe9bd6c2691ae4d6ce334dbc2f1be9106cba3bcdf]: Confirmed âœ… 
    Token contract address: 0x9AB60992B6257c65A89D141f24d4ec7BE5241366

Once again, for convenience, you can export the `BRISKATALL_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable with the contract address output by the deploy command. Alternatively you can pass it via the `--token-contract-address` flag to all commands that need it:

    $ export BRISKITALL_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x9AB60992B6257c65A89D141f24d4ec7BE5241366

Then to check that everything is working, you can list the token balance of the MultiSig contract:

    $ ./briskitall.sh query token balance "${BRISKITALL_MULTISIG_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}"
    10000000000

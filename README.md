# Brisk-It-All

## Name?

We needed a name for a multisig app, and so naturally we opened the Denny's Menu. Brisk-It-All seemed right:

> Slow-cooked brisket burnt ends, crispy diced bacon, two eggs*, aged white cheddar, Diner Q sauce and pickles on grilled artisan bread. Served with wavy-cut fries.
